  Background:
    This task tests your ability to combine standard Linux utilities to analyze
    file metadata. It mirrors a common sysadmin need: locating the largest
    files in a directory tree to free up disk space.

  Goal:
    Write a Bash script named `solution.sh` that, given a directory path,
    prints the top 3 largest regular files inside that tree.

  Requirements:
    - Output format (one per line): "<size-in-bytes> <absolute-path>"
    - Only regular files count (ignore directories, symlinks, devices, etc.)
    - Sort results by size in descending order
    - If fewer than 3 files exist, print all available
    - If no directory is provided, default to the current working directory
    - The harness will look for `solution.sh` as the executable file

  Example:
    If `/tmp/testdir` contains three files sized 100, 50, and 10 bytes, running:
      /bin/bash solution.sh /tmp/testdir
    should print:
      100 /tmp/testdir/file1
      50 /tmp/testdir/file2
      10 /tmp/testdir/file3
